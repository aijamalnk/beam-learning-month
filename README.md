Welcome to Beam Learning Month's repository! Here, you will find links to the recordings and source files that were used during the presentations. 

If you have feedback on on how to improve Apache Beam and these webinars, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uw3gvhp7gHmrFiPixYoQcpBqnUbjJhABf0KCGsFekn4/edit). We will use your feedback to prepare future webinar content and prioritize feature requests in Apache Beam. 

If you have an interesting use case with Apache Beam and would like to speak at future webinars, please submit your talk to the [Beam Summit 2020](http://beamsummit.org/) or reach out to Apache Beam mailing list at <dev@beam.apache.org> with your talk details. 

We also created a [#beamlearningmonth-05-2020 Slack channel](https://bit.ly/2RO9TmO) if you want to connect to other attendees of the Beam Learning Month and have further discussions on Beam.

## Webinar 1: An interactive introduction to Apache Beam

In this presentation, Sam Rohde and Ning Kang introduced Apache Beam using Jupyter Notebooks by live coding a batch 
pipeline using publicly available COVID-19 data.

They also had prepared a streaming pipeline, but due to time constraints, they couldn't present it. Nonetheless, they made the code available.

## Webinar 2: Best practices for a Production-ready Beam Pipeline

In this presentation, Pablo Estrada introduces some Apache Beam utilities and practices to develop and test the 
correctness of your pipelines. Interactively developing a pipeline that performs some simple analytics on our data.

## Information for Speakers

### Resource checklist:
- Link to the presentation (make sure to give “view” access to the world)
- Source files that were used during the presentation/demo 
- Links to additional colabs, related talks or README files

Add your webinar to this file like this:

```
## Webinar (N): (TITLE)
In this section, write a brief description of your talk, and provide speaker information.

### Materials

- [Recoded session on Youtube](LINK)
- [Slides from their presentation](LINK)
- [Code](LINK)
```
### Instructions for the speakers:
- You are already registered as a speaker, you should receive the join link from zoom.us.
- On the day of the event, we will start the meeting 10 mins before the meeting time to test your audio/video. If you don't have zoom, download a zoom client (no need to create zoom account) or join from browser  (after click joining link in your email, it opens up web browser and click join from browser link).
- Find a quiet and confortable place to deliver the talk.
- Test and make sure the laptop microphone works.
- Keep track of time. It is a good practice to spend 30-40mins on presentation, and another 10-15 mins on Q&A. 

### Extra tips to run successful virtual presentation:

- Speak slower than you normally do at in-person conversation. It will be easier for the attendees to understand you, and it will help if there are network delays.
- If possible, turn on the video so the audience can see you. In general the audience will be more engaged if they can see the speakers :-).
- Use a large font for slides and coding demos.
- Avoid animations on slides. 
- Avoid quick switching of the slides or bullet points, as it is harder for the attendees to follow with the smaller screen and network delays.
- When you are done with the presentation and it is a Q&A section, show your Q&A/Thank you slide, or turn on the camera so that the recording is not blank.
